//! Unit tests for toolpath generation with rotation
//!
//! NOTE: These tests are currently disabled due to API changes in shape structs.
//! The shape structs (DesignRectangle, DesignEllipse, etc.) have been refactored
//! and no longer have fields like x, y, offset, fillet, chamfer, layer_id.
//!
//! These tests need to be rewritten to match the current shape API.
