# Archived: designer.rs and helpers.rs
This folder contains legacy code that was moved from the active `src/app/` area during Slint removal and migration of helpers to crate-local `helpers.rs` modules.

Files moved here:
- `designer.rs` (formerly `src/app/designer.rs`) — archived for historical review and to preserve earlier logic.
- `helpers.rs` (formerly `src/app/helpers.rs`) — archived; helper functions were migrated into crate-local modules for `gcodekit5-ui`, `gcodekit5-designer`, and `gcodekit5-visualizer`.

These files are kept for reference only and are not used by the GTK-based build.
